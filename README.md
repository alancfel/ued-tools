# ued-tools
Matlab code for processing and interpreting data from Ultrafast Electron Diffraction (UED) experiments

# 1. Introduction
UED is a type of pump-probe experiment where a sample of interest is excited by a laser pulse (pump) and probed with a similarly short high-energy electron pulse.  The time delay between the pump laser and the electron probe is varied precisely and the experiment is repeated many times to produce a series of diffraction patterns with a range of time delays between the pump and probe.
